This repository contains my code for solving the problems on Exercism's TypeScript exercises, available here: https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises

To run any of the scripts, use

> npx tsx '.\exercises\Hello World\index.ts'

Replacing the folder and filename as necessary.

Or to run in watch mode

> npx tsx watch '.\exercises\Hello World\index.ts'
